    "# What is a static method in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are methods within a class that have no access to anything else in the class (no `self` keyword or `cls` keyword). \n",
    "\n",
    "- They cannot change or look at any object attributes or call other methods within the class. \n",
    "- They can be thought of as a special kind of function that sits inside of the class. \n",
    "- When we create a static method we must use something called a [decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#syntactic-sugar). The decorator for a static method is `@staticmethod`. Don't worry about it, you will see more about it later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can create a callable class using the static method and use it with some restrictions. It helps developers write code in a safe architectural way to prevent conflicts in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We'll go deeper into the decorators later.)"
